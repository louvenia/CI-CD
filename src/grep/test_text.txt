Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
L
ike I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
